# HW0

[HW0 + Julia Video Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RetAn_9AOMg)

## Getting Started
All the homeworks are distributed as Jupyter notebooks. Follow these instructions to get everything set up.

1. Install Julia. Download v1.6.7 from the [Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/#long_term_support_release). From here you can follow these [platform specific instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) to get started. 
2. Clone this repo and put it wherever you want.
2. Start a Julia REPL in your terminal using `julia`, or the location to the Julia binaries.  If this doesn't work, make sure you followed the [platform specific instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/).
3. Install the [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) using the Julia package manager. In the REPL, enter the package manager using `]`, then enter `add IJulia` to add it to your system path.
4. In the REPL (hit backspace to exit the package manager), enter `using IJulia`
5. Launch the notebook using `notebook()` or `jupyterlab()`

## HW Instructions
