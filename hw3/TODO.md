Q1 part A: how to debug a solver? -> solved by changing the control limit. 
Q1 part C: check the tracking performance? -> it is okay. 
Q2 part A: forward pass failed -> sign is wrong in the control law, resolved. 
Q3: is not strictly feasible, constrains cannot be satisfied
    -> check control spikes
